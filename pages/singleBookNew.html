                <h4>The Hunger Games #0.5</h4>
                <h2>Sunrise on the Reaping</h2>
                <h3>Suzanne Collins</h3>
                <p>The phenomenal fifth book in the Hunger Games series!</p>
                <p>When you've been set up to lose everything you love, what is there left to fight for?</p>
                <p>
                    As the day dawns on the fiftieth annual Hunger Games, fear grips the districts of Panem. This year,
                    in honor of the Quarter Quell, twice as many tributes will be taken from their homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back in District 12, Haymitch Abernathy is trying not to think too hard about his chances. All he
                    cares about is making it through the day and being with the girl he loves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Haymitch's name is called, he can feel all his dreams break. He's torn from his family and his
                    love, shuttled to the Capitol with the three other District 12 tributes: a young friend who's nearly
                    a sister to him, a compulsive oddsmaker, and the most stuck-up girl in town. As the Games begin,
                    Haymitch understands he's been set up to fail. But there's something in him that wants to fight . .
                    . and have that fight reverberate far beyond the deadly arena.

               <h4>Suzanne Collins</h4>
                <h2 class="aboutAuthor">About the Author</h2>
                <p>Since 1991, Suzanne Collins has been busy writing for children’s television. She has worked on the staffs of several Nickelodeon shows, including the Emmy-nominated hit Clarissa Explains it All and The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo. For preschool viewers, she penned multiple stories for the Emmy-nominated Little Bear and Oswald. She also co-wrote the critically acclaimed Rankin/Bass Christmas special, Santa, Baby! Most recently she was the Head Writer for Scholastic Entertainment’s Clifford’s Puppy Days.</p>
                <p>While working on a Kids WB show called Generation O! she met children’s author James Proimos, who talked her into giving children’s books a try.</p>
                <p>Thinking one day about Alice in Wonderland, she was struck by how pastoral the setting must seem to kids who, like her own, lived in urban surroundings. In New York City, you’re much more likely to fall down a manhole than a rabbit hole and, if you do, you’re not going to find a tea party. What you might find...? Well, that’s the story of Gregor the Overlander, the first book in her five-part series, The Underland Chronicles. Suzanne also has a rhyming picture book illustrated by Mike Lester entitled When Charlie McButton Lost Power.</p>
                <p>She currently lives in Connecticut with her family and a pair of feral kittens they adopted from their backyard.</p>  
                <p>The books she is most successful for in teenage eyes are The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. These books have won several awards, including the GA Peach Award.</p>
